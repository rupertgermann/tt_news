2009-11-24  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* clean-up: updated copyrights and class comments
	* fix: changed instantiation of the BE ajax object to prevent use of deprecated functions in TYPO3 4.3

2009-10-28  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* clean-up: moved flashmessages.css from res/ to compat/ folder and changed references to this file accordingly

2009-10-27  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* changed styling of messages in the extensionmanager and in the updater to the flashmessages style from TYPO3 4.3.
	  Added a new css file (res/flashmessages.css) which is loaded in older TYPO3 versions where the flashmessages
	  styles are not present in the general backend stylesheet.
	* added some more locallang labels for the updater
	* added a "suggest" wizard to the field "related news" (works only in TYPO3 4.3)
	* added "onchange=reload" to the "codes" (what to display) field in the plugin's flexform
	* changed the PHP and TYPO3 requirements: as of now tt_news requires at least PHP 5.0 and TYPO3 version 4.1
	* changed the way how the update message in EM is rendered. Added a new field for this message because in TYPO3 4.1
	  there is no type=user in TS ()before this change the updater message was bundles to the field "useStoragePid").

2009-08-19  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* fix: displayCurrentRecord is now working again (thanks Krystian Szymukowicz)

2009-07-28  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* fix: the pagebrowser in the newsadmin module didn't work correctly under TYPO3 4.2.x. Moved all locallang labels, icons and
	  css styles to tt_news.

2009-06-14  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* Added french labels for new localized options in constant-editor, extmanager and updater (thanks to Rachel Foucard)
	* added a new label to each updater function which displays information about what the updater is going to do.

2009-06-04  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* new feature: added the new pagebrowser from the listview to the tt_news admin listview 
	  (class tx_ttnews_recordlist::renderListNavigation())
	* fix: the categorycount cache was always written no matter of a cached value was found or not.
	* fix: added missing () around the lifetime part of the getfromcache query for the internal caching.
	* changed the db-engine of the tt_news_cache table to innodb.

2009-06-02  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
*** DB table changes ***
 	* connected the internal caching from tt_news to the TYPO3 caching framework (requires at least TYPO3 4.3). By default it's configured to
 	  use the DB backend but of course it will work with all other available caching backEnds too (tested with memcached, APC, filecache and DB)
 	* Added a switch to the extmanager config where one can choose the "caching Engine" (options: internal, cachingFramework). If the caching
 	  framework is not available (TYPO3 < v4.3) tt_news automatically falls back to the internal caching.
 	* Moved the caching related functions to their own classfile: lib/class.tx_ttnews_cache.php
 	* changed the "lifetime" handling of cache entries to use the same system as the caching framework.
 	* changed the fieldnames of table tt_news_cache to make it work with the caching framework and the internal caching.
	* fixed bug #11236:  Wrong param passed to getSubCategoriesForMenu
	* fix: moved the call to function initCategories() inside the $codes loop because initCategories() requires $this->theCode to be set.

2009-05-25  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

*** DB table changes ***
	* performance improvement: internal caching of processing intensive values.
	  - archive periods: getting the newscount for every archive period is a quite "expnsive" operation as there can be
	    a lot of these periods. These counts are now cached internally which reduces the rendering time of the archive menu drastically.
	  - categories: the categories (and also subcategories) for a news article are now stored in the internal cache, too.
	    This reduces the amount of queries which has to be made to display a listview.
	  - internal caching for newscounts in category menus with 2 stages: getting the newscounts for categories is also a very expensive
	    operation especially when the categorymenu is a USER_INT object (which is required for the ajax expand/collapse to work)
	    Now the newscounts are cached seperately for each category and also in an array containing the complete counts for a category 
	    menu in a certain state.
	* SQL query improvements:
	  - the "Distinct" subselect for the listquery is now only added if it is actually needed (in case when news are selected
	    by category)
	  - removed the "orderby" part from the count query for lists
	* added indices for tt_news.datetime and tt_news_cat.parent_category

	* new extmanager options:
	  useInternalCaching (as the name says, enabled by default),
	  cachingMode: this determines the cache entries lifetime and if the internal cache from tt_news will be cleared by TYPO3.
				"normal": (default) the cache entries will get the same lifetime as normal pages. The tt_news cache will be cleared
				  when the "clear all caches" button is pressed.
				"lifetime": will set the livetime of cache entries to the given amount of seconds in field "cacheLifetime".
				  The cache table is not cleared when "clear all caches" is clicked.
				"static": the lifetime of cache entries is set to zero (= unlimited). TYPO3 does not clear the tt_news cache
				  (useful if you clear the cache with an external script or for debugging).
	  cacheLifetime: lifetime in seconds of the internal cache entries (used only when cachingMode is "lifetime").
	  writeCachingInfoToDevlog: Which information about internal caching should be written to devlog (extension "devlog" required).
	    "disabled": don't write any information about caching to devlog.
	    "cache misses": log only cache misses.
	    "all": log cache misses and cache hits to devlog.
	  parsetimeThreshold: Execution time in seconds after which a single function is logged to devlog. Default is 0.1 sec = 100ms.
	    any function in tt_news which needs more time to be executed will be logged. The execution time indicates the severity of the log entry:
	    0-0.2 sec = 0 (info), 0.2-0.5 sec = 1 (notice), 0.5-1 sec = 2 (warning) and everything above 1 second get severerity 3 = error.

	* added a lot of TS default variables to setup.txt (These options are not new but before they were only mentioned in the manual and were
	  not visible by default in TypoScriptObjectBrowser)
	* changed the default TS for date formatting for all "codes" to a consistent format (%d.%m.%Y) and removed the non localized "of" in
	  displaySingle.date_stdWrap.strftime

	* "related news by category" do now have their own TS namespace. Before this the settings for relNewsByCat had to be 
	  configured in "displayList." which made it quite unhandy to configure. Now "related news by category" use relNewsByCategory{} 
	  which is a copy of the whole plugin.tt_news{} array. This makes it possible to deliver an "out-of-the-box" working default 
	  configuration and it gives you more possibilties to adapt the output to your needs.
	* added a TS condition to disable the icons in related news by a TS constants switch.
	* added a TS condition to directly switch the archiveMode and change the rendering of archiveTitleCObject accordingly 
	  by a TS constants switch.
	* changed initialisation of "multipageSingleView". Now useMultiPageSingleView is not activated automatically anymore when 
	  maxWordsInSingleView has a non zero value.
	* singleView pagebrowser now uses the same pagebrowser as a normal list view (with own config array: plugin.tt_news.singleViewPageBrowser)

	* moved the pagebrowser initialisation/call to a new function: getPagebrowserContent()
	* the archivemenu is now able to display dates in the future
	* fix for xmlIcon path: now "EXT:" is resolved correctly in the image path
	* cleanup: moved all record icons to the new folder res/gfx/



2009-05-05  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* new feature: generic markers (thanks to Georg Ringer for his ttnewsgenericmarkers extension). Generic markers allows you to define new
	  HTML template Markers and render any field from the tt_news record to them without writing a single line of PHP.
	* new feature: it's now possible to enable the "Crop"-Mode for news images directly in the Constant Editor (listImageMode, latestImageMode)
	* performance fix: moved a call to getSelectConf() from function getNewsCountForCategory() to the init function of the catmenu class because
	  it was called multiple there.
	* cleanup: changed all calls to the different getSubCategories() methods to tx_ttnews_div::getSubCategories(). removed the unneeded methods
	  from class.tx_ttnews_helpers and class_tx_ttnews_tcemain
	* fix: added alot of missing calls to $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->sql_free_result($res)
	* performance fix: changed the initialization of $this->pageArray in class tx_ttnews. This array was initialized with all pages in the
	  pid_list which was quite expensive when there was a huge pid_list. $this->pageArray is used to output some data of the news sysfolder
	  to the tt_news $markerArray.
	  Now $this->pageArray is used as cache for already fetched pagerecords which will only be fetched (by the new method 
	  getRelatedNewsByCategory()) if they are actually needed and if there is a marker for them.
	* cleanup: moved the code for getting newsfiles, related news by category and for the xml markers to own functions:
	  getXmlMarkers(), getFileLinks(), getRelatedNewsByCategory()
	* fixed bug #10708: added 2 missing references to function getSIngleViewLink() to make it possible to alter the singlePid
	  by a hook.


2009-04-17  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* fixed bug #10921: added exclude=1 to tca config of field author_email

2009-04-09  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* updater: new feature: added some more options to the updater script: it is now able to ckeck for values in the moved Flexform fields:
	  pages (startingpoint), recursive, listLimit and noPageBrowser. These values will be moved to the field in the correct sheet.
	* updater: enhanced the "check for not existing html template" function: this function checks now if the found template entry
	  actually exists in the filesystem and offers to unset the value if the template file doesn't exist anymore.
	* moved all text from the constants.txt files to tt_news/locallang.xml
	* reformattd code in class.tx_ttnews.php
	* fix: added an empty (Set by TS) option to the "what to display" (code) selector in FF. fix: added an empty (Set by TS) option to the
	  "what to display" (code) selector in FF. Without this it was not possible anymore to leave CODE empty and override it from TS.

	* refactored the updater script. Added language labels and moved all text to tt_news/locallang.xml
	* moved all text from ext_conf_template.txt to tt_news/locallang.xml (those labels require a colon : to divide the header from the helptext)
	* because the description field from TSConstantEditor could not be localized, I converted the field useStoragePid to "user" and re-added
	  the now localized updater-message to ext_conf_template.txt. (new file: lib/class.tx_ttnews_tsparserext.php)

	  Note: "user" fields in constants editor require at least TYPO3 4.2. In older Versions the checkbox for this option is shown as simple
	  input field but no error occurs. This affects only the new info-message for the updater, the updater itself should work in all TYPO3
	  versions.
	* added missing XCLASS statements
	* moved some more functions from pi/class.tx_ttnews.php to lib/class.tx_ttnews_helpers.php
	* changed some mysql definitions for better dbal compatibility: converted all tinytext fields to varchar(255), removed NOT NULL statements
	  from fields without default value.


2009-04-07  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* replaced the outdated updater script (class.ext_update.php) with a new one that fixes the 2 most common problems when updating an
	  existing tt_news installation	from 2.5.x to 3.0.0.
	  1. since I moved the static/ folder to the pi/ directory all references to the static tt_news ts templates are broken after updating.
	     the updater script fixes this by searching the affected templates and updating them with an updated field "include_static_file"
	     where the wrong paths have been corrected.
	  2. In case the old default template (EXT:tt_news/pi/tt_news_v2_template.html) was used in flexform configuration this will fail because
	     I renamed this template. The updater script can fix this by setting the template path to an empty value in all tt_news flexforms
	     where it was used. Then tt_news will render the news with the default template which is configured by TS. Flexforms with other
	     templates than tt_news/pi/tt_news_v2_template.html will not be changed.
	* added a message to ext_conf_template.txt which informs the user about the new updater.


2009-04-04  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* new feature: now the category menu can show the number of news in each category.
	  This can be enabled/disabled by TS: displayCatMenu.showNewsCountForCategories (default=0)

	* performance enhancement: replaced the "renderFields" feature with "renderMarkers" by Dan Osipov - thanx Dan!
	  although renderMarkers does basically the same as renderFields it is the smarter concept, because it doesn't need any configuration.
	  The existence of a certain marker in the html template let's tt_news execute the code that is needed for this marker. 
	  Means: every code line that fills a certain marker is now wrapped with a condition which checks the existence of this marker 
	  before the code is executed.



2009-04-04  Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* fix: removed call to t3lib_div::makeInstanceClassName() from fe_index.php which generated mysql error messages in FE during ajax 
	  calls from category menu. (only occured in TYPO3 4.3dev, probably caused by the deprecation log).

	* new feature: "useSPidFromCategoryRecusive". If activated tt_news searches through the parent categories for a singlePid.

	* fix: added a scrollbar to the category tree in news-admin module

	* fix: removed the default entry for the tt_news html template in both flexform files.
	* new feature: by setting "showTitleAsPrevNextLink" the previous/next links in tt_news single view can now show labels for 
	  "previous" and "next" instead of the news title. The title is still added to the title-attribute of the link.
	* new option: reversePrevNextOrder. As the name says: reverses the order of the "next" and the "previous" links. The "next" 
	  marker will be linked to the previous news article (useful if you use different fields for ordering news on your website).
	* added a TS option to inlude the prototype library or not in FE (needed for the ajax cat menu)
	* removed the function index comment from class tt_news
	* moved helper functions from class tt_news to an external helper class (lib/class.tx_ttnews_helpers.php)
	* reverted the splitted init() functions change. reason: most of the initialisation is needed by almost all renderfunctions, 
	  so the benitfit of splittin these functions would not be very high.
	* fix: added a check in the generated link to prevent double adding of the siteUrl






2008-05-02	Dmitry Dulepov	<dmitry@typo3.org>

	* Fix: pi_alwaysPrev was used in makePageBrowser() but was not initialized

2008-04-20	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* enhancement: grouped the constants in 3 sections: "basic" (templatefile, pid_list, singlePid, backPid, archivelink), "xml-feeds"
	  (feed-related settings) and "advanced" (all the rest). In most cases it should be sufficient to fill out the pids in the basic section to
	  get an output from the news plugin.
	* fix: the fe listview did show not-published versions when dontUsePidList was enabled.
	* updated function indexes

2008-04-20	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* fix !IMPORTANT! requires DB update (related to bugs 3531,3907): "news records loose categories when published/swapped into WS".
	  Solution: removed all "unsigned" attributes from the mm tables in ext_tables.sql. Now publishing of news with categories or related
	  news works correctly in TYPO3 version >= 4.1.7

	* new feature: with the new TS parameters "amenuStart" and "amenuEnd" it's now possible to configure an AMENU content element to display
	  news only from a certain period.
	* new feature: "displayCatMenu.catPidList" and "displayCatMenu.recursive" give users the possibility to set a pidList for the categorymenu
	  content element. (overrides GRSP if given)
	* new feature - stolen from timtab ;-): the singleview can now display two links that point to the previous and next article
	  (template markers: ###PREV_ARTICLE###, ###NEXT_ARTICLE###). The field which is taken to select the previous/next article is configurable:
	   plugin.tt_news.displaySingle.nextPrevRecSortingField (default: datetime)
	* new feature: the catmenu can now be configured to add/not add the archive parameters to its links. plugin.tt_news.catmenuWithArchiveParams
	  (default = 1)
	* improved tree display in BE:
		- if useStoragePid is enabled each tree shows the GRSP folder and its id as rootIcon
		- in be_users/groups the categories are now grouped by sysfolder.
	* new feature: added a searchbox to the news-admin module (same as in web->list). if the search shows or not is configurable in TSConfig:
	  mod.web_txttnewsM1.list.show.search (default = 1)
	* new feature: with "mod.web_txttnewsM1.list.clickTitleMode" it's possible to configures the behavior of the record-title link in lists in
	  the news-admin module. Possible values are: "edit" link editform, "view" link FE singleView, (any other value: no link, default=edit)
	* changed the "open-preview" link in lists to the same js-window as all other preview links
	* fix: now the list in the news-admin module excludes unpublished versions
	* fix: adapted the news-admin list to styles to TYPO3 4.2RC2
	* fix: the title of the fe-catmenu is now localized
	* fix: related news links do work with realurl now
	* code cleanup: started to re-arrange the init() order in class.tx_ttnews. One goal is to find out "what to display" (theCode) first,
	  and afterwards initialize the needed vars and not vice versa like it was before. Current state: the init() order is changed and all
	  "display..."() methods have their own init function wrapper -> TODO: fill the selective init functions.



2008-04-14	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* added document: doc/tt_news_3.0_changes.sxw (summarizes all changes and new features in tt_news 3.0) not yet finished
	* new feature: with "mod.web_txttnewsM1.list.clickTitleMode" it's possible to configure the behavior of the record-title 
	  link in lists in the news-admin module. Possible values: "edit" = link editform, "view" = link FE singleView, any other 
	  value: don't link. Default is "edit". The "edit" link is only inserted if the user has sufficient permisssions, the 
	  "view" link needs a value for "tx_ttnews.singlePid" (TSConfig) to work.
	* performance improvement for the BE module: If a non admin user with many visible pages in his db-mounts opens the 
	  news-admin module the script has to check for each page if the user may edit it. This is quite time consuming and 
	  so I added a caching mechanism which stores the editperms for each page and the md5hash of the pidList (= list of 
	  all mounted pages) in the be_sessions table. Now the permissions are only calculated once per Session.
	  
	  ATTENTION: page permission changes which don't change the pidList will be ignored until the be_user session changes (re-login required)
	  
	* fix: it was not possible to mount/allow non-root categories in trees. This error was introduced when I changed lots of 
	  stuff in the trees to get rid of the tables and xajax.
	* improved the handling of allowed/disallowed categories in BE trees. FIXME -> making categories un-selectable with 
	  "tt_newsPerms.tt_news_cat.allowedItems" doesn't work currenlty
	* all methods in class.tx_ttnews_div are called statically now.


2008-04-12	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* Changed handling of StoragePid/GRSP:
		* category tree in tt_news, tt_news_cat and tt_content: If "useStoragePid" is enabled and no GRSP is given the script 
		  looks for categories in the current page.
		* category tree in be_users/groups: the tree shows all categories from all pages ("useStoragePid" is ignored)
		* news-admin module: If "useStoragePid" is enabled (and GRSP is visible for the current user) the module diplays all 
		  categories found in the current GRSP - no matter which page is actually selected in pagetree. The selection in the 
		  pagetree filters only the displayed news and not the categories.
		* If "useStoragePid" is enabled and NO GRSP is given, only the categories from the current page will be displayed 
		  (that was the behaviour also with given GRSP before this change).
		* improvement: The tree header displays the pid where the current categories have been found.
	* new feature: added a checkbox to the BE list view which allows users to switch off the image thumbnails.
	* new feature: added a TSConfig option to show the "create new category" button or not (mod.web_txttnewsM1.catmenu.show.btn_newCategory = 1)
	* new feature: added a TSConfig option to configure the size of the thumbnails (mod.web_txttnewsM1.list.imageSize)

	* fix: the AMENU didn't take the pid_list into account when doing the count() queries for the archive periods
	* improved the message handling in the tree for tceforms. Now the messages are partly localized - not yet finished
	*

2008-04-10	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* Changes in module 'news admin':
	* new feature: added a level selector offering the following options: show news from all pages, from this page only and 
	  from this page and 1 to 4 levels down.
	* new feature: the record titles in the list are now linked to the FE single view. The pid of the single view is configured 
	  with the same value which is already used for the 'save & preview' button (TSConfig: tx_ttnews.singlePid)
	* new feature/fix: Added the missing 'no news found' message and a 'Create new article' button which are displayed when the 
	  result list is empty. Whether the 'create new' button appears or not depends of course on the current user's permissions.

	* fix: removed some superfluous commas from the js files which caused errors in Internet Explorer.
	* fix: changed require($BACK_PATH.'init.php'); to require_once... in mod1/ index.php because it threw a php error on ajax 
	  actions caused by the double inclusion of init.php.
	* fixed bug #8048: removed the useless 'displayList[Latest].image < displaySingle.image' lines from all TS files.
	* tweak: improved the internal time logging for the fe-plugin. It writes the parsetimes to the devlog now and it marks 
	  entries with exceptionally high parsetimes with different error levels.


2008-04-06	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* fix for bug #8021: removed superfluous marker ###COMENTS### from template single_record_insert
	* fix: removed a "call time pass by reference" in class tx_ttnews_TCAform_selectTree which caused a PHP error
	* version number is now: 3.0.0

2008-04-06	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* Changes in module 'news admin':
	* added support for allowed/disallowed categories
	* added support for user/page TSConfig and added a default configuration to pageTSConfig in ext_tables.php
	* new checkbox (list): 'Show only editable records'. Allows the user to switch the display of not editable news articles 
	  on or off. (this checkbox is invisible for admins)
	* new checkbox (tree): 'Show hidden categories'. Allows the user to switch the display of hidden categories on or off.
	* all checkboxes can be hidden in TSConfig: mod.web_txttnewsM1.list.show.cb_[name of the checkbox] and 
	  mod.web_txttnewsM1.catmenu.show.cb_[name of the checkbox]
	* added an extra icon for news which are not editable due to disallowed categories
	* added a language selector which shows the languages (page_language_overlay records) of the allowed pages of a normal 
	  BE user, or it shows all languages if the user is admin.
	* new TSConfig option: 'mod.web_txttnewsM1.defaultLanguageLabel'. Overrides the label for the default language in the language selector

	* added a check to the tree class for BE forms which informs the user if a category he edits is not in the general record 
	  storage page (if the use of GRSP is enabled).
	* improved the 'no categories found' message: added a list which links the pages with news categories where the user has 
	  access to (inspired by templavoilá).
	* new clickmenu options in tree: 'add new category on this level' and 'add subcategory'. Additionally to the 
	  'new category' button on top of the tree these 2 options allow the user to create categories at a certain level in the tree.
	* did a lot of improvements in the clickmenu class (f.i. the clickmenu items for manipulating records do now only show up 
	  if the user has edit permissions)


2008-04-04	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* moved all templates to folder pi/ to res/
	* added a new html default template: tt_news_v2.6_template.html


2008-04-03	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* Implemented optionSplit for tt_news lists: (bug:7141). Thanks JONAS DÜBI and cabag.ch for the patch.
		Now things like this are possible: plugin.tt_news.displayList.image.file.maxW = 300|*|200|*|100||100||100
		means: the image-width of the first item will be 300px, the last 3 items will be 100px. The items in between will have 200px width.
	* Since parsing for splitted options needs extra perfermance you can disable optionSplit by setting 
	  plugin.tt_news.enableOptionSplit=0 if you don't need it.

	* Enabled optionSplit for templateparts/alternatingLayouts: with the new parameter "altLayoutsOptionSplit" it's possible 
	  to control the templatepart number by optionSplit.
		example: plugin.tt_news.altLayoutsOptionSplit = 0||1|*|2||3||4|*|5||5||5 (limit set to 11)
		This can be directly used with the included LIST2 template and will use the templateparts in this order: 0,1,2,3,4,2,3,4,5,5,5
		if "altLayoutsOptionSplit" is set "alternatingLayouts" will be ignored.

	* Enabled optionSplit for images in singleview: with the new parameter "imageMarkerOptionSplit" it's possible to use multiple 
	  imagemarkers for the images in the single view. 
		example: plugin.tt_news.imageMarkerOptionSplit = 1|*|2
		will render the first image to marker ###NEWS_IMAGE_1### and all others to marker ###NEWS_IMAGE_2###
	* new code/template part: SINGLE2. Only change to normal SINGLE template is, that it uses multiple image 
	  markers which can be configured by "imageMarkerOptionSplit"

	* flexform changes: cleaned up the flexform, added some missong localisation labels, moved some fields to other sheets.
	* new flexform option: "Template part number / optionSplit of template part numbers". Same as "altLayoutsOptionSplit" 
	  in TS but applies only to the current content element.
	* new flexform option: "OptionSplit for cropping lenght of subheader". This overwrites the "lenght" parameter from 
	  subheader_stdWrap.crop with an optionsplitted value (applies only to the current content element). This parameter 
	  is also available in TS: "plugin.tt_news.croppingLenghtOptionSplit"
	* more optionsSplits ? ;-) : now the fields "imagesize" and "imagewidth" in flexforms can also be filled with splitted options.
	* fix #6659: added 2 new options to the recursive selecor in the flexform: "defined by TS" and "0 levels". 0 levels allows to 
	  override a globally given value for recursive by 0 for only one content element.
	* new option/marker: plugin.tt_news.archiveActiveMarkerContent is filled to the marker ###ARCHIVE_ACTIVE### when the current 
	  archive period is selected. By default this marker is rendered to the opening <li> tag of an archive item and it is filled 
	  with 'class="amenu-act"'.

	* fix #4304: changed TS for the single view to render the linksItem_stdWrap around each link and not around all links. new: 
	  'linksItem_stdWrap.parseFunc.nonTypoTagStdWrap.encapsLines.innerStdWrap_all.wrap = <dd>|</dd>''

	* fix: set maximum of attached files to 100
	* fix: the "RTEfullScreenWidth" for the tt_news.bodytext field is now set to 100% as in tt_content

	* introduced a new function to class tt_news which renders only the images for the single view.
	* continued the code cleanup (changed while/list to foreach ...)


2008-04-01	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* new TS option "plugin.tt_news.renderFields": Contains an array of CODEs and which fields to render in each code (not used 
	  for rss feeds: code=XML).
		If a field is not listed here it is not renderend. The fieldlist can be set to "*" to render all fields.
		Example: plugin.tt_news.renderFields.SINGLE = *
		Actually not all fields can be switched off, I added the condition "if (isRenderfield($field))" only to 
		"image,category,short,bodytext,related,links,news_files".
		Reason for this effort is to prevent tt_news from wasting time with unneeded things like f.e. parsing the 
		complete bodytext through lib.parseFunc when showing latest news where the marker ###NEWS_CONTENT### is not displayed at all.

	* performance improvement: Changed all occurences of SIM_EXEC_TIME to SIM_ACCESS_TIME and added a fallback for 
	  older TYPO3 versions since SIM_ACCESS_TIME is new in TYPO3 4.2.
		Background: by default TYPO3 adds a condition to each sql query which checks if the values for starttime, endtime, hidden, 
		deleted and access allow the display of this record.
		starttime and endtime are compared to the current time in each query. Since the value for "current time" (SIM_EXEC_TIME) 
		changes each second, mysql has almost no chance to re-use a result from its cache. SIM_ACCESS_TIME changes this behaviour 
		by keeping its value for 60 seconds. If the same information is requested again from mysql during this timeframe the 
		result will be delivered from the mysql cache. THANKS to Martin K. for implementing this in the TYPO3 core!

	* new TS option "plugin.tt_news.ignoreEnableFields": I replaced the calls to tslib_content::enableFields in 
	  class tx_ttnews by an internal method which allows to manipulate the "$ignore_array" before calling sys_page::enableFields. 
	  By adding starttime and endtime to "ignoreEnableFields" the comparison of these fields with SIM_ACCESS_TIME is completely 
	  removed from the query allowing mysql to use its cached results for a longer period than the 60sec of SIM_ACCESS_TIME.

	* added a new function getSingleViewLink(): This method is called to render all links pointing to a singleView 
	  (links in list, related news)
	* new register "newsMoreLink_url": additionally to "newsMoreLink" which contains the complete "more" link, 
	  this register contains only the URL of this link (available in displayList/Latest and for related news)
	* new hook "getSingleViewLinkHook": can be used to manipulate the singleView links
	* new hook "sViewSelectConfHook" (bug 6740): Allows to manipulate the query for the single view.

	* added some missing conditions to prevent calling stdWrap for empty fields to function getItemMarkerArray
	* fix: links to related news are showing the correct dates now, when useHRDatesSingle is enabled.
	* moved the some manipulations of the selectConf array from function displayList() to function getSelectConf(). 
	  Now it's possible to alter the groupBy/orderBy part of the query with the selectConfHook.
	* fix in tcaForm_selectTree: already selected categories don't loose their css class anymore when expanded/collapsed.
	* better highlighting of parents of selected categories
	* improvement (bug 7507): the archivemenu distinguishes between 1 item and more than 1 items now. Means: besides 
	  the existing language label "archiveItems" there's a new label called "archiveItem" which is displayed if an 
	  archive period contains only 1 item.
	* fix: added a limit ($selectconf[max]) to the main list query. Up till now the given limit from TS was only used 
	  to end the loop which renders the list content and it did not reach the sql query. Visible effect of this bug was 
	  that lists with many results did need significantly more time to render than list with less results no matter of 
	  the value of "limit" and the number of actually displayed records.


2008-03-29	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
  	* fix: news with zero datetime will cause the amenu to search all periods starting from 1970. I added a new 
  	  TS parameter which disables this by default: ignoreNewsWithoutDatetimeInAmenu = 1
  	* replaced the call to exec_getQuery in the amenu loop by a direct call the exec_SELECTquery which is noticeable faster.
  	* improved the overall performance of the amenu by replacing "while(list ...)" by "foreach" where possible and moving 
  	  some conditions out of loops.
  	* removed some double checks for pid_list and enablefields from functions getWhere() and getQuery()
	* added lots of comments and did some "code beautifying" in the TypoScript file ts_new/setup.txt
	* added a stdWrap for the complete tt_news output: plugin.tt_news.stdWrap
	* added 2 TS parameters "defLangLabel" and "defLangImage" which configure label and flag image for the default language (L=0)
	* fix: catSelectorTargetPid was ignored in the settings for the catogory rootline



2008-03-29	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* replaced function getFEHelp() by a new function displaErrors() which displayes the collected configuration errors. 
	  Moved the help template and its image from pi/ to res/
	* new parameter: plugin.tt_news.enableConfigValidation (default: enabled). Disable this option, if the config validation 
	  makes problems with your site.
	* removed the listStartID option from the flexforms (obsolete since 'excludeAlreadyDisplayedNews' exists).
	* updated all function indexes

2008-03-28	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* new codes: added 3 more items to the "what to display" list: LIST2, LIST3 and HEADER_LIST (they use all the 
	  plugin.tt_news.displayList namespace for configuration)
	* changed the 2-box selector to a single dropdown menu where only one item can be selected
		!!! ATTENTION !!! this might break compatibility with some sites where more than one code for one news content element is used
		IMO using more than one code in the same content element is not recommanded anyway, because mostly you 
		would need more configuration options for smaller groups of news items and not putting them all in one content element 
		where you've f.e. only one image size available.
	* the "what to display" labels are now localized

	Typoscript changes:
	* The "general_stdWrap" is now disabled by default: Each single field which needs parsing is connected directly to 
	  lib.parseFunc_RTE (f.i.: content_stdWrap.parseFunc < lib.parseFunc_RTE). The class="bodytext" attribute is disabled by default, too.


	HTML Template changes:
	* removed the marker ###MORE### from the default HTML template: The "more" link is now appended directly to the subheader by TS.
	* Added 2 more LIST templates: LIST2 and LIST3 (using alternating layouts, for a bit more advanced listviews)
	* modified the single view: introduced a floated div which groups author, categories and date in the right upper corner

	CSS
	* cleanup: removed almost all colors, borders and fontsizes from the default CSS styles.
	* added new example styles for the new LIST templates



2008-03-27	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* compatibility: introduced a new folder named compat/ for scripts that are needed to make the tt_news category tree work 
	  in older TYPO3 versions.
	
	The current state is this:

	TYPO3 4.0.x:
	* For this version I dropped the support for expandable trees in tceforms
	* if Xajax is installed the tree in the "tt_news category manager" module (web > info) can be expanded/collapsed
	* The FE catmenu can be expanded/collapsed but without ajax
	* The new Module "news admin" is not visible

	TYPO3 4.1.x
	* all category trees in tceforms and the "catmenu" content element can be expanded/collapsed with internal ajax routines 
	  (no xajax required)
	* if Xajax is installed the tree in the "tt_news category manager" (web > info) can be expanded/collapsed
	* The new Module "news admin" is not visible

	TYPO3 4.2.x
	* The new Module "news admin" is visible and replaces the  "tt_news category manager" module in web > info
	* All category trees in BE and FE have full ajax support (no xajax required)

2008-03-24	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* moved the functionality of the amenuUserFunc script to the tt_news main class.
	* Grouping the amenu periods by years can be enabled by plugin.tt_news.showYearHeadersInAmenu (default=1).
	* The year is rendered to the new template marker ###ARCHIVE_YEAR### and it has a stdWrap named "archiveYear_stdWrap"
	* added the tt_news db fields to ['db_layout']['addTables']. Now the function which renders the tt_news records in the 
	  page module could be removed from EXT:cms/class.db_layout.php


2008-03-23	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	changes in the newsadmin module:
	* adapted the news newsadmin to the new BE layout
	* the newsadmin module shows the category tree and a listview of news side by side
	* the listview can be filtered by clicking on the category titles in the tree
	* if a category is selected, the "new" button in the list creates a news record in this category

	other changes:
 	* added more tabs to the tt_news record and enabled tabs in tt_news categories
 	* removed the scrollbar from the tceforms category tree div. The option "max height for the category tree" has been 
 	  removed too. Now the category menu shows always all expanded categories
 	* integrated the check for disallowed categories with the new "highlight tabs with required fields" feature from 
 	  TYPO3 4.2 -> means: a yellow exclamation mark appears in the "categories" tab when there are disallowed categories. 
 	  (That made it possible to remove the "use type-field to check categories" hack)
	* raised the minimum required TYPO3 version to 4.1 - recommanded version is 4.2 (the newadmin module show only in TYPO3 >= version 4.2)
 	* cleaned up the code from many files (f.e. removed checks for non-supported TYPO3 versions)

	and lots of other small improvements ;-)

2008-03-21	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* removed obsolete class.tx_ttnews_treeview.php (replaced by file: class.tx_ttnews_TCAform_selectTree.php)
	* modified and renamed the class for rendering category trees in BE forms (new name: lib/class.tx_ttnews_TCAform_selectTree.php)
	* All ajax driven category trees should now work correctly and without requiering xajax
	* renamed some more files and functions

2008-03-21	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* moved the static/ folder from the tt_news main dir to pi/
	* cleaned up the html template and css file
	* removed the "ts_old" static TS template option
	* moved the main function call for tt_news from the static setup file to default TS Setup. this makes it possible 
	  to collect errors in the plugin configuration and display messages when certain TS options are not set.
	* renamed cshimages/ to csh/ and moved the csh xml-files to this folder
	* moved clickmenu class to cm1/
	* moved all classes from the main dir to lib/ (exept ext_update.php)
 	* created a js/ folder and moved js files to this folder
	* fixed some problem with the redirectUrl after ajax operations in the BE module
	* changed some TS options to reasonable defaults:
		* dontUseBackPid: activated by default. Now the links to news singleviews do NOT contain the parameters 
		  anymore which are needed to build the dynamic "back to list" link in the singleview. Adding these parameters 
		  will cause problems with caching (multiple cache entries of the same singleview page due to different cHashes), 
		  indexed_search (multiple search results) and realUrl. If you use this extensions in combination with tt_news - 
		  which seems to be the case quite often - leave dontUseBackPid=1 and configure a static backPid.
		* usePiBasePagebrowser: activated by default. I also improved the wraps for the different parts of the pagebrowser
		* excludeAlreadyDisplayedNews: activated by default. If there are multiple tt_news plugins on one page, the articles 
		  which are diplayed in one plugin are excluded from display in the other plugins.
		* useSubCategories: activated by default.
		* ignoreUseSubcategoriesForAndSelection: activated by default. If 'useSubcategories' is enabled and a news plugin 
		  is configured to display only news which are members of the selected categories AND their subcategories it's quite 
		  unlikely that you'll get some results. Therefore 'useSubcategories' will be ignored for this plugin when 
		  categoryMode is set to 2 (AND).
		* useHRDates: activated by default. Uses 'year' and 'month' as GETvars for the archive period instead of 'pS' and 'pL'.
		* displayCatMenu.mode: ajaxtree. Enables the new ajax category menu for the CATMENU content element.



2008-03-19	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	2.6.0dev
	requires: TYPO3 4.2
	* modified of the category tree classes to get rid of xajax.
	* The FE catmenu and the BE category manager are now using a slightly modified version of the new typo3ajax class.
	* The module "tt_news category manager" does now have its own BE main module called "news admin".
	* TODO: remove xajax from the category trees in Forms

	* many other small changes where I'll hopefully find the time to write them in the manual soon ;-)
	* cleaned up some stuff in the tx_ttnews main class: f.e.: renamed function newsArchiveMenu to displayArchiveMenu, 
	  inserted section comments...

2008-03-19	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>
	* created the branch tx_ttnews-2.6.0dev.

2008-03-17	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* fixed the fix for bug #7181: Added "DISTINCT(tt_news.uid),tt_news.*" to the list-query to get rid of the 
	  "groupBy tt_news.uid" part of that query. Only removing the groupBy clause is not enough because then news 
	  with multiple categories will be displayed multiple.
	* upload to TER as version 2.5.2

2008-03-15	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* Fixed bug 5103: fix for the nonvisible categories in selectors when "General record storage page" was used.

	* fix: the string 'http://' in external urls (type=2) is now detected correctly
	* added the layout Fixes from Dmitry to the example CSS file (THANK YOU Dmitry for helping out!!)
	* upload to TER as version 2.5.1

2008-03-03	Dmitry Dulepov <dmitry@typo3.org>

	* Added search hooks
	* Extension version is manually set to 2.5.1
	* Added 4.2-compatible way to show plugin info in Page module

2008-02-13	Dmitry Dulepov <dmitry@typo3.org>

	* Fixed bug #6881: Division by zero
	* Fixed bug #6671: XClassing of class.tx_ttnews_catmenu.php does not work

2008-01-28	Dmitry Dulepov <dmitry@typo3.org>

	* Fixed CSS layout problem with tt_news_remplate_v2.html on FireFox

2008-01-08	Dmitry Dulepov <dmitry@typo3.org>

	* Added section about tt_news add-ons to the manual

2007-10-31	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* fix: prevent link targets from being changed in localized records (Thanks to Stefan Galinski)

2007-08-16	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* added "softref" parsing to the field bodytext

2007-05-20	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* fix for bug 4445: tt_news displayed non clickable links for relations to news without translations in sys_language_mode "strict".
	* fix: removed hardcoded space between preAuthor and author and added a stdWrap for preAuthor: preAuthor_stdWrap
	* fix: added a line that unsets the piVar "month" when the archive works in mode "yearly"

2007-02-28	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* updated function indexes - no actual code changes
	* uploaded revised manual (Thanx Ben)
	* version 2.5.0

2007-02-20	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* fixed a small bug which caused asc/desc from Flexform to be ignored if a value for 'listOrderBy' was present in TS. 
	  Thx to Ernesto for the hint.

2007-02-19	Ingo Renner <typo3@ingo-renner.com>

	* new feature: RSS 2.0 feeds displaying full length news records now, credits Michael Feinbier

2007-02-18	Ingo Renner <typo3@ingo-renner.com>

	* new feature: list view can select news for a certain day only now - to play nice with TIMTAB (bug #2941)
	* new feature: RSS 2.0 feeds deliver files attached to news records as <enclosure>s (feature request #4950)

2007-02-15	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* fixed a small bug in function getSubCategoriesForMenu which caused tt_news to display only 50 subcategories-
	* updated the manual with the new features

2007-02-09	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* fix for bug 4948: in TYPO3 4.1 a cHash error occured when links to related news were clicked (thx to Oliver Hader).
	* fix: added a condition to ext_tables.php which disables the "tt_news category manager" module in TYPO versions 
	  below 4.0 (reason: the drag and drop code isn't present in these versions)

2007-01-26	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* fix: the ajax category tree works correctly with different charsets now.

2007-01-25	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* new feature: "don't use pid_list". In sites with huge pagetrees where it is needed to have the news not 
	  in a few sysfolders but in the complete pagetree the check for the pid_list in tt_news can be a big performance 
	  eater because thousands of pages have to be checked for visibility and added to the sql query. From now on it 
	  is possible to disable the use of the parameters "pid_list" and "recursive" when the TS var 
	  "plugin.tt_news.dontUsePidList = 1" is set. Thank goes to Franz Ripfel for sponsoring this feature.
	* new feature: added a new backend module called "tt_news category manager". This module is located under web/info. 
	  It shows the complete category tree - of course expandable and collapsable - and offers drag and drop for moving 
	  and copying news categories.
	* thanks: Many thank goes to: CNV (Christelijk Nationaal Vakverbond) for sponsoring the ajax category tree.
	* improvement: rewrote the check for recursive categories. Creating recursive categories is now prevented by a 
	  function which hooks in tcemain. This works for normal category records and for the category manager
	* improvement: removed the file flexform_ds_no_sPID.xml because it is not needed anymore.
	* changed copyrights to 2007

2007-01-15	Ingo Renner <typo3@ingo-renner.com>

	* new feature: forceFirstImageIsPreview (see manual)

2006-12-09	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	* new feature: if the extension xajax is installed, the category tree in BackEnd forms can now be expanded and 
	  collapsed. If you have a huge category tree this will speed up the rendering of the tree significantly. This 
	  feature still needs some work because it collides with the check for recursive categories which is currently 
	  disabled.
	* improvement: if a subcategory of a category is selected the tree shows the titles of the parents of this 
	  category with underlined text.
	* new feature: "Exclude already displayed news". The new TS option "excludeAlreadyDisplayedNews" allows you to 
	  place multiple news plugins on one page where the plugin itself takes care that no newsarticle is displayed 
	  twice. This feature makes the options "excludeLatestFromList" and "listStartId" obsolete. If 
	  "excludeAlreadyDisplayedNews" is enabled "excludeLatestFromList" and "listStartId" will be ignored.


2006-08-23	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

	  allowed and visible categories for a certain be_user/group with the category tree. If categories are selected in 
	  the be_user/group records the TSconfig settings 'options.useListOfAllowedItems', 
	  'tt_newsPerms.tt_news_cat.includeList' and 'tt_newsPerms.tt_news_cat.allowedItems' have no effect anymore. 
	  (thanks to netcreators.nl for sponsoring this feature)
	* new file: added a new php class 'class.tx_ttnews_div.php' which contains some helper functions for the BE classes.
	* improvement: the selected categories in the category trees in BE are highlighted with bold font.

	* updated function indexes and copyrights
	* version nr: 2.3.3

2006-04-18	Rupert Germann <rupi@gmx.li>

		- new feature: "versioning preview". If the extension "version" is enabled on the system, a new "code" 
		(VERSION_PREVIEW) will be added to the "what to display" selector in the tt_news content element. If a 
		content element with this code exists on a page, it does nothing until the GPvar "ADMCMD_vPrev" is set 
		which indentifies a version preview. Unfortenutely the id of the page for the version preview is not 
		configurable, so the VERSION_PREVIEW element has to be on the next displayable page above the news 
		sysfolder in the pagetree.
		- If a version preview is displayed a message with a link to the original version of the article will 
		be inserted above it. TSparameters: versionPreviewMessage_stdWrap and versionPreviewMessageLinkToOriginal_stdWrap.
		- new feature: "direct preview". The "save & view" button in the tt_news record in BE does open a 
		"single" view of the current record now. The singlePid for this page has to be set in pageTS config: "tx_ttnews.singlePid".
		- tt_news uses different names for the pagebrowser pointer in list and latest now. this makes it 
		possible to have up to 3 indipendend pagebrowsers at one page (single,list,latest).
		- fix: "latestWithPagebrowser" is working now. (thanks Marlies for pointing me to that)
		- improvement for "editlock": Now all actions concerning records with an editlock are disabled for 
		non-admin BE users (copy,move,modify,delete,version,localize).
		- the same actions are prevented for records with categories that are not allowed for the current BE user.
		- fix: the marker ###XML_DECLARATION### for xml feeds will now be substituted in feeds without items.
		- improved handling of localized records with non-allowed categories.
		- added display of categories from the original record to the localization of a news record
		- new feature (extconfig): now it's possible to disable the "[translate to ...]"-prefix in text 
		fields of localized news articles. (switches between the l10n_modes 'prefixLangTitle' and 'mergeIfNotBlank')
		- new feature (extconfig): the image field in localized news articles can be made editable now. 
		(switches between the l10n_modes 'prefixLangTitle' and 'mergeIfNotBlank')
		- added and edited many function comments
		- added all FE error-messages to pi/locallang.php

		- the width of both category fields is configurable now. By default the script detects the browser and make the field wider in case of IE is used.
		- added an error message which appears when recursive categories where found. Recursive categories will be not displayed in the tree window because class.treeview returns nothing for those categories.
		- added a message that appears when "useStoragePid" is activated but the current category is not located in the genaral record storage page.
		- added icons to the wizards in the category record ("create category" and "create subcatgegory")
		- added an "edit" wizard to the category record
		- added some conditions to tca.php to set the target pid for category records which have been created with the "add" (+) button according to the "useStorage" setting. (if useStoragePid is disabled, those records will be created in the current page). Those should prevent the well known error message "Attempt to insert record at page 0 ...." when no Genral Record storage page have been set.

		- new feature: A list of allowed categories can be configured for each be_user or group (TSconfig). The non allowed categories are displayed in grey and the user can't select them.

		- new feature: Now it's possible to prevent editing of news records by their assigned categories. If the record has categories assigned that are not in the list of allowed categories, saving of this record will be disabled. (useful for restrict further editing of a record after a certain category has been assigned to it)
		- new feature: the "add new record" button (+) in the category db-record is creating a new subcategory of the current category. (XCLASS for typo3/wizard_add.php).
		- new feature: added an "editlock" field to the tt_news db_record. By activating this field, editing of the record can be disallowed for non admins. (works only in TYPO3 3.8.0 currently)

		- new feature: 'insert pagebreaks after a certain amount of words' (new function insertPagebreaks()). It's now possible to configure the amount of words after that a pagebreak is inserted. If the amount of words is reached, the script looks for the next dot (.) and inserts a pagebreak after it. The value for 'maxWordsInSingleView' can be configured globally by TS or for a single Content-element in the FF sheet. Additionally it is possible to switch off automatic Pagebreaks for a single news article with a checkbox in the tt_news record. (has to be improved to make shure, that no pagebreaks are inserted in html tags).
		- added a new marker for the pagebrowser in the singleview: ###NEWS_SINGLE_PAGEBROWSER###. it is also possible to append the pagebrowser to the bodytext without a special marker by setting 'appendSViewPBtoContent=1'
		- the subheader is now only displayed on the first page of a singleview with multiple pages. If this is not wanted the subheader can be configured to appear on all those pages by setting 'subheaderOnAllSViewPages=1'

	* cvsroot/typo3xdev/tx_ttnews/static/ts_old/setup.txt 1.6:
		- new feature: single view with multiple pages. It's now possible to divide the single view in multiple pages by adding a configurable 'pageBreakToken' to the bodytext field. The default 'pageBreakToken' is <---newpage--->. the complete feature is enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting 'useMultiPageSingleView = 0'.
		The images for the additional pages in the single view are assigned by there position in the imagelist in the BE form. example: if you have 6 images assigned and set imageCount for the single view to 2, then the first 2 images will appear on the first page the second 2 images will appear on hte second page and so on.
		- to get a pagebrowser for the news single view it was necessary to add a new pagebrowser function to the tt_news class (function makePageBrowser). This pagebrowser is a copy of the piBase pagebroser where I added a possibility to configure the name of the pointer (singleViewPointerName) and chaching is now enabled.
		- the list view uses now the new internal pagebrowser too. the piBase pagebrowser can be re-enabled by setting 'usePiBasePagebrowser=1'.

	* cvsroot/typo3xdev/tx_ttnews/tca.php 1.23:
		- new feature: 'bidirectional Relations': if you set a relation between two news-records and you enable this feature (plugin.tt_news.useBidirectionalRelations = 1) you'll see the relation in both records on the website. The relation back from the target-record to the source is inserted automatically. In the BE you won't see the relation.
		- new feature: 'related pages': if you enable this feature (plugin.tt_news.usePagesRelations = 1) you can now assign pages as related news. Those 'related pages'are handled as news with type set to 'link to internal page' so no changes to the TS of the getRelatedCObject are needed.
		- fix: the title of related news are now displayed in the correct language. (thank goes to Christian Ullrich who sent the patch)
		- the feature 'single pid by category' can now be disabled by setting: plugin.tt_news.useSPidFromCategory = 0
		- the function geRelated() is now respicting the visibility of categories that are assigned to the related news-records. If one of the categories is not vicible for this user, its title and images will not appear, if all assigned categories are disabled the related news record will not appear. (works for subcategories too).

	* cvsroot/typo3xdev/tx_ttnews/tca.php 1.22:
		- added the fields 'endtime','starttime','hidden' and 'fe_group' to the tt_news_cat table
		- new feature: the new 'enable fields' from the tt_news_cat table are now processed in the tx_ttnews class. That makes it possible to f.e show news from some categories (and their subcategories) only for users that are member of a certain fe_group or only for a timeperiod.
		- enabled the field 'sorting' for the table tt_news_cat_mm. The order of the categories that are displayed on the website is now the same, as the order of the categories in the left selectorbox in the tt_news BE-form.
		- in the table tt_news_cat, the sorting field is now enabled too. This fields defines the ordering of the categories in the right selectorbox in the tt_news BE-form. The order of the subcategories, if some of them are found in the same level, will also be defined by the sorting-field, if no other field is set by 'plugin.tt_news.catOrderBy'. (the default for catOrderBy was uid before)
		- added a stdWrap to 'categorySelection'. Now something like this will work: 'plugin.tt_news.categorySelection.data = register:whatever'
		- changed the condition that finds out if a record is normal newsarticle or a Link. This condition checks now if the type is 1 or 2. This has no influence on the functionality, but will make it easier to add new 'types' to tt_news when extending it.
		- added a function that checks the visibility of the selected categories: function checkRecords().
		- removed function initCategories().

		- version number is now 2.0.6

	* cvsroot/typo3xdev/tx_ttnews/pi/class.tx_ttnews.php 1.68:
		- new TS-var 'dontUseBackPid':
		If you enable this, you can prevent the use of the variables for dynamic back-Links in links, that point to the single-view. The advantage is, that all those links will look the same, what will f.e. prevent multiple indexing by the indexed search. (RealUrl Links will also look nicer without a backpid). The backlink in the single-view will still function, but it will only point to a global BackPid (f.e. the list view)

		- new possiblity to render the "more" link. Now this link can also be rendered by TS by wrapping it with the stdwrap.append function to the subheader text. This has the advantage that this link appears in the same line (and the same p-tag) as the last line of the subheader/bodytext in list views.

		- added two new fields for image alt text and title to the be form. with this fields you can add different alt and title texts to each image

		 - new feature - added some new fields to the tt_news content-element: listStartID, limit, noPageBrowser, imageWidth, imageHeight. with the new Field "listStartID" you can set the item from which the list (or latest) content-elemnt should start.
		in combination with the other fields you can realize complex combinations of news content-elements f.e to display a big header element and list of smaller elements below. (hint: this is completely incompatible with the pagebrowser)
		Thank goes to paolo nugnes for sponsoring this feature.
		- small fix in the language menu: now it works also with "hide default translation of the page" activated -> result is: the  default language is dimmed and not linked
		- updated manual with new features
		- updated changelog
		- version number is now 1.7.9

		--- Major changes ---
		- added new html template (pi/tt_news_v2_template.html)
		- added new stylesheet for this template (res/tt_news_v2_styles.css)
		- moved all html-tags for content that is not required to the TS template. there should be no empty tags anymore when there is no content in the db-field.
		- moved ALL TS_setup- and TS_contstants-files to the new folder "static/". this folder holds 3 subfolders for 2 different TS-setups:
		  setup 1: TS settings for the "classic" table-based template (with fonts, globalWraps, globalColors ....)
		  setup 2: consists of two subparts: the TS settings for the new CSS-based (XHMTL valid) template and the css styles for this template
			which can be included seperately as css_default_style from the third static ext-(TS)template.
		- added two new template markers that build a wrap for the additional data in the single view (###ADDINFO_WRAP_B### ###ADDINFO_WRAP_E###).
		   this wrap is only inserted if there is at least one of the elements: related, files or links present.
		- added new template markers for a wrap for all categories ( ###CATWRAP_B### and  ###CATWRAP_E### )
		- changed the wrapping of the author: now also the author prefix is wrapped in the author wrap.

		- some fixes for rss conformity: added the new function cleanXML which removes '&nbsp;' from the rss feed content.
		- changed the link building for the links to the single view in rss feeds: now also links to internal and external sites are working in the rss-feed
		- added a preg_replace which replaces the squarebrackets in the links with their rawurlcodes and the &-sign with its ASCII code (rawurlencoding the complete link caused non-functional links)
		- version number is now 1.7.7

		- enabled 'dividers2tabs' for the tt_news form in BE
		- added 'l10n_modes' for the most fields in TCA -> now some of the fields e.g. images will take their content from the default language and are not editable in the translated version
		- enabled display of the 'l18n_parent' (record in the default language) for translated records
		- changed the order of the fields in the tt_news db-resord to group them under 3 tabs.
		- added a new template marker: ###LANGUAGE### (is wrapped with a stdWrap, so you can also output flag-images)
		- added the sys_language_mode 'strict' for news records. now you can choose by ts wheather all news are showing or only those in the current language
		- some fixes for rss validity: now the authors email instead of his name is submited in the news items,
		- moved the author tag from the rss2 tmpl to the script to display it only if there is an email given.
		- version number is now 1.7.6
		- updated function api/doc

		- changed the id handling of translated news. now all links to newsrecords point to the uid of their original translation. this makes the fallback for not translated news work like the translations for normal content.
		- version number is now 1.7.5
		- added an example configuration for tt_news with realUrl. see file: res/realUrl_example_setup.txt

		- the pagetitle in the backToList link inthe single view now shows the title of the language overlay if one is found.
		- removed some not needed parameters from the backlink (-> gives better looking realUrl Adresses)
		- added a fix for the archive, that show no items when one item has an empty datetime field. thx heike for pointing me to this.
		- added a possibility to process new user codes/templateparts as news-list. You can define new codes in the array ['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['tt_news']['what_to_display']
		and process them by a small userfunction that call the getNewsList function from within the tt_news class. example will follow.

	* cvsroot/typo3xdev/tx_ttnews/res/tt_news_languageMenu.php 1.6:

		- changed the link processing in the language menu. Now the additional params for the linka are build from the GetVars. The effect of this change is, that you can use the tt_news-language menu with simulateStatic. It still does not produce links like �home+M098098.html� but it works ;-)
		- Inserted new function that returns the template subpart (suggested by Stefan Geith). This gives you the possibility to �XCLASS� tt_news for pre-processing the html-template.
		- Fixed the �firstImageIsPreview� function. (added the forgotten parameter $textRenderObj to the getImageMarker function)

		- Moved the part, that fills the image markers, from the function getItemMarkerArray() to a new function: �getImageMarkers()�.
		- Added a  possibility to process the image markers by a user function. This userfunction works a bit different from the others: if it is enable, the images are only processed by the userfunction not by both functions. (this could already be done by the 'itemMarkerArrayFunc' but this would process the same images two times)
		- Added an new example script: �res/example_imageMarkerFunc.php� that uses the new userfunction to add different wraps to the images in single view (see comments in file for needed TS-settings)
		- changed the formating of the �back to list� link in single view: now you can define the string for the backlink in this way: �Back to: %s� - �%s� is the title of the page, where the backlink points to
		- added a new TS-var 'hscBackLink': By setting this var, you can choose, whether the backLink-string is parsed through htmlspecialchars() or not.
		Fixed a small bug with some stdWraps that referenced to the not initialized var $lConf: (�archiveHeader_stdWrap�, �archiveEmptyMsg_stdWrap� and �noNewsIdMsg_stdWrap�)
		- added 2 new flexform fields for ordering the news in list and latest-view
		- added 2 new TS-vars for ordering and grouping the List and Latest view: �listOrderBy�. And �listGroupBy�. Use this with care: the queryparts given from TS are only trimmed and not further validated -> if the field don't exist you'll get a mysql-error
		- if you set �listGroupBy = category� the string �category� is processed in a special way, because the tt_news_cat_mm table is not joined by default. This simulates the �group by category� functionality by joining the mm table to the tt_news table. (see line 643 in class.tx_ttnews.php) .
		The result of this is:  you can configure f.e. a  �latest� content element to show only the newest news-record of each category.
		Restriction: this works only correct, if the news records have only one category assigned.
		- updated api docs & changelog

	* cvsroot/typo3xdev/tx_ttnews/res/example_imageMarkerFunc.php 1.1:

		-> this influences the BE form, the �age� output and the archive.

		- Changed the building of the getRelatedCObject. -> Now it is (again) possible to wrap the titles of related news with stdWraps (e.g. crop)

		*Important*: this requires changes in the TS setup for tt_news -> see: example configuration in ext_typoscript_setup.txt, *and* it also requires that you change the old TS varname �PIDitemDisplay� to the new one �singlePid� in constants and setup. (otherwise the related news are not linked)

		- New feature: you can now configure the �order by� and �group by� parts of the query for the related news by TS. (new TS-vars: �orderBy� and �groupBy� )
		- added �required� to the field newsfiles in tca.php
		- added some conditions to the function getItemMarkerArray, that will render wraps only if an item is found
		- changed the caching settings of the search function
		- to save performance, the getRelated function is now only called, when displaying the "single view" template.

	* cvsroot/typo3xdev/tx_ttnews/tca.php 1.9:
		- removed the Tsvar �itemLinkType� -> since the links are all build with typolinks this parameter is not needed anymore.
		- removed the unnessecary parameters from some links (e.g. the category-links that point internal pages need no archive parameters)
		- added new TSvar: �latestWithCatSelector�. If this is not set (default), the newsLatest element is excluded from the catselector. If you set this var, �LATEST� will change its contents with the catselector as newsLIST does (which was the  behaviour till now).
		- added new TSvar: �amenuWithCatSelector�: the same for amenu.
		- added new TSvar �catSelectorTargetPid�: Needed in framesets, to define a page where the category-selector links point to (e.g. Category-selector  links in a �LATEST�-element in left frame point to the �LIST� view in the frame for the normal content). Maybe also useful in �non-framed� pages.
		- New db column/ form field �n tt_news_cat: �shortcut_target�: this fixes the problem, that category shortcuts in framesets always have the target defined by the itemLinkTarget. This made it impossible to use links to non-frames pages AND links to pages in framesets, at the same time as category shortcuts. Now you can define the target for each category shortcut in the tt_news_cat db-record.
		- Added 'allowCaching' to the constant Editor.
		- Removed some empty vars from default setup.
		- Changed version number to 1.5.2
