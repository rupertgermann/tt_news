				<source>In the field "Parent category" you can define the current category as a subcategory of the category which is selected in this field. That will include the current category and the newsitems which have this category assigned when the parent category is selected. This works recursive.
					A new parent category for the current category can also be created directly with the "add" wizard (the plus button).
					Some categories in the tree are printed in grey and are not selectable: the current category is never selectable, additionally it is possible to define a list of categories that are allowed for a certain BackEnd user group in the TSconfig of this group (f.e.: tt_newsPerms.tt_news_cat.allowedItems = 7,8,9). All categories that are not in this list will not be selectable for members of this group.
